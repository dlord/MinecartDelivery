MinecartDelivery
=============

_Automated storage minecart deliveries_

Purpose
------------

This server mod came from the frustration of broken minecart pez dispensers in SMP. All I ever wanted was to be able to transfer huge amounts of material from one point to another with minimum hassle.

Minecart Mania is supposed to implement this feature, but it hasn't been updated for quite some time.

Out of that frustration came this little plugin.

It has one feature: allow a storage minecart to unload its contents to a drop off point automatically.

Features
------------

* Drop off points are created by simply putting a detector rail and a chest along your existing minecart system.
* Supports double chests

Installation and Usage
------------------------------

Just drop MinecartDelivery.jar into your plugins directory, and you're ready to go.

To create a drop off point, you will need a chest and a detector rail. The chest must be one block lower than the detector rail. Once a storage minecart passes thru the rail, it will unload the contents to the adjacent chests automatically.

Below is an example of a drop off point:

Limitations
---------------

This plugin does not support the following:

* Permissions
* Multi-world support

Before you ask why, it's simple: at the moment I don't have any need for these in my own server, hence the lack of support for it.

Support
-----------

This plugin is fairly new, and is being tested on our server. If you find any bugs, please file a ticket.

Download
--------

A built jar file is available for download [here](https://github.com/downloads/dlord/MinecartDelivery/MinecartDelivery.jar).

I will be uploading the latest stable version here. I will also update the one in [bukkitdev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/minecartdelivery/), but because they require approval, it'll probably take some time.
